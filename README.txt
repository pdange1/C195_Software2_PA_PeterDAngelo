Directions to Run the Program:
======================================================
1) When running the app within intellij, login and that will take you to the main screen of the program.

2) In the main screen you will see all appointments and customers within two tables. You can filter the types
of appointments using the drop down menu at the top of the appointments table. 

3) From the main screen, there you may navigate to the add and modify customers screens. To delete
customers or appointments, select one in their respective tables and click delete. Deleting a customer will delete all
associated customer appointments. 

4) On the add appointments and customers screens, be sure that every field is filled with data otherwise it will not save.

5) Located on every page is a save or cancel button. The cancel button navigates you back to the previous page and the 
save button saves whatever data you are inputting into the page. 

6) On the reports screem you may filter the first report using the radio buttons to select which appointments you want to see
whether it be all appointments, all appointments within the month, or within the week. 

7) To exit the program, click the x button in the upper right of whatever screen you have open, or navigate back to the 
main screen and click the exit button.

Additional Report Description:
======================================================
My additional report tracks the number of customer 
appointments in a particular country and returns a number count 
for each customer appointment within that country. 
This provides the user with information on whether or not they 
have a higher user base within a certain region.
